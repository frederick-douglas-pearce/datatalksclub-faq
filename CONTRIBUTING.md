# Contributing to DataTalks.Club FAQ

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the DataTalks.Club FAQ! This guide will help you understand how to propose new FAQ entries or updates.

## Proposing a New FAQ Entry

We have an automated system that helps maintain the FAQ repository. Here's how to propose a new FAQ entry:

### 1. Create a New Issue

1. Go to the [FAQ Proposal form](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/faq/issues/new?template=faq-proposal.yml)
2. Fill out the form:
   - **Course**: Which course this FAQ is for (e.g., `machine-learning-zoomcamp`)
   - **Question**: The FAQ question
   - **Answer**: A clear, helpful answer with examples if applicable
   - Check the validation boxes

### 2. Automated Processing

Once you submit your issue, our FAQ Bot will automatically:

1. **Analyze your proposal** using AI to compare it with existing FAQs
2. **Make a decision**:
   - **NEW**: Create a new FAQ entry if the question isn't covered
   - **UPDATE**: Update an existing FAQ if your proposal adds valuable context
   - **DUPLICATE**: Mark as duplicate if the question is already fully answered

### 3. What Happens Next

#### For NEW or UPDATE Decisions

- A Pull Request will be automatically created with the proposed changes
- The PR will include:
  - The new or modified FAQ file(s)
  - Explanation of why this action was chosen
  - Section placement and reasoning
- A maintainer will review the PR
- Once approved, your FAQ contribution will be merged!

#### For DUPLICATE Decisions

- The bot will comment on your issue with:
  - Explanation of why it's considered a duplicate
  - Link to the existing FAQ that covers your question
  - Link to the source file
- The issue will be automatically closed
- If you believe this is incorrect, you can reopen and mention a maintainer

## Writing Good FAQ Entries

### Question Guidelines

- Be specific and clear
- Use the actual words students might search for
- Start with question words (How, What, When, Why, etc.)
- Examples:
  - ‚úÖ "How do I install Python dependencies using uv?"
  - ‚ùå "Dependencies"

### Answer Guidelines

- Start with a direct answer
- Include code examples when relevant
- Add links to documentation or resources
- Keep it concise but complete
- Use markdown formatting for readability

**Example:**

````markdown
### Question

### Answer
