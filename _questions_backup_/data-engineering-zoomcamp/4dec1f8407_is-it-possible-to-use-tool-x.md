Yes, this applies if you want to use Airflow or Prefect instead of Mage, AWS or Snowflake instead of GCP products or Tableau instead of Metabase or Google data studio.

The course covers 2 alternative data stacks, one using GCP and one using local installation of everything. You can use one of them or use your tool of choice.

Should you consider it instead of the one tool you use? That we can’t support you if you choose to use a different stack, also you would need to explain the different choices of tool for the peer review of your capstone project.
