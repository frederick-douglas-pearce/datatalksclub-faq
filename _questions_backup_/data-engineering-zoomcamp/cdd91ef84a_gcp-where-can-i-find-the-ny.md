The ny-rides.json is your private file in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 

And here’s the way to find it:

GCP -> Select project with your  instance -> IAM & Admin -> Service Accounts Keys tab -> add key, JSON as key type, then click create

Note: Once you go into Service Accounts Keys tab, click the email, then you can see the “KEYS” tab where you can add key as a JSON as its key type
