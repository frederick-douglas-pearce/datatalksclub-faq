question: 'Authentication: Why is my OPENAI_API_KEY not found in the jupyter notebook?'
sort_order: 260

Option1: using direnv

created the .envrc file & added my API key, ran direnv allow in the terminal

was getting an error: "OpenAIError: The api_key client option must be set either by passing api_key to the client or by setting the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable"

resolution: install dotenv & add the following to a cell in the notebook. You can install dotenv by running: pip install python-dotenv.

from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv('.envrc')

Option 2: using Codespaces Secrets

Log in to your GitHub account and navigate to Settings > Codespaces

There is a section called secrets where you can create Secrets like OPENAI_API_KEY and select for which repositories the secret is supposed to be available.

Once you set this up, the key will be available in your codespaces session
