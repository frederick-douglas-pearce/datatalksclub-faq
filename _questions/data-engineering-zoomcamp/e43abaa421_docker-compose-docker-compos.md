This is happen to me after following 1.4.1 video where we are installing docker compose in our Google Cloud VM. In my case, the docker-compose file downloaded from github named docker-compose-linux-x86_64 while it is more convenient to use docker-compose command instead. So just change the docker-compose-linux-x86_64 into docker-compose.
