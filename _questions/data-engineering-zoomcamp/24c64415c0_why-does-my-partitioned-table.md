If your partitioned table in BigQuery shows as non-partitioned, it may be due to a delay in updating the table's details in the UI. The table is likely partitioned, but it may not show the updated information immediately.

Here’s what you can do:

Refresh your BigQuery UI:
If you're already inspecting the table in the BigQuery UI, try refreshing the page after a few minutes to ensure the table details are updated correctly.

Open a new tab:
Alternatively, try opening a new tab in BigQuery and inspect the table details again. This can sometimes help to load the most up-to-date information.

Be patient:
In some cases, there might be a slight delay in reflecting changes, but the table is very likely partitioned.
