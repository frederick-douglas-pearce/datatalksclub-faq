If you're encountering an error when trying to create a GCP free trial account, the issue isn’t related to country restrictions, credit/debit card problems, or IP issues, it's a random problem with no clear logical reason behind it. Here’s a simple workaround that worked for me:

I asked a few friends in my country to try signing up for the free trial using their Gmail accounts and their debit/credit cards. One of them was able to successfully create the account, and I’m temporarily using their Gmail to access the trial.

If you're still running into the issue, this method could help you bypass the problem!
