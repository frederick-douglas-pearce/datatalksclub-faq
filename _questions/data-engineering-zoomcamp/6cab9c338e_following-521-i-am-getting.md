question: Following 5.2.1, I am getting an error - Head:cannot open ‘taxi+_zone_lookup.csv’ for reading: No such file or directory
section: Module 5: pyspark
course: data-engineering-zoomcamp
sort_order: 3430

The latest filename is just ‘taxi_zone_lookup.sv’ so it should work after removing the ‘+’ now.
