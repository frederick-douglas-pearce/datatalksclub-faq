If you're following video DE Zoomcamp 4.3.1 - Building the First DBT Models, you may encounter an issue at 14:25 where the Lineage graph isn't displayed and a Compilation Error occurs, as shown in the attached image.

Don't worry—a quick fix for this is to simply save your `schema.yml` file. Once you've done this, you should be able to view your Lineage graph without any further issues.
