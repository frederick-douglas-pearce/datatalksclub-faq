**Issue:** If you don’t define the column format while converting from CSV to Parquet, Python will "choose" based on the first rows.

**Solution:** Define the schema while running the `web_to_gcp.py` pipeline.

Sebastian adapted the script:

To make the file work with gz files, add the following lines:

- Ensure deletion of the file at the end of each iteration to avoid disk space issues:

```python
file_name_gz = f"{service}_tripdata_{year}-{month}.csv.gz"
open(file_name_gz, 'wb').write(r.content)
os.system(f"gzip -d {file_name_gz}")
os.system(f"rm {file_name_init}.*")
```
