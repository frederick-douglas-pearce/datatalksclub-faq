question: Question 3 of homework 6 if i see that rmse goes up at a certain number
  of n_estimators but then goes back down lower than it was before, should the answer
  be the number of n_estimators after which rmse initially went up, or the number
  after which it was its overall lowest value?

When rmse stops improving means, when it stops to decrease or remains almost similar.
