question: What is the difference between .decision_function() and .predict_proba()?
sort_order: 25

In Scikit-Learn’s LogisticRegression, a model that is trained will have raw values and the predicted probabilities.

- **.decision_function()** returns raw values that are a linear combination of the features and weights, similar to the output of Linear Regression.

- **.predict_proba()** goes one step further by inputting these raw values into the sigmoid function to convert them into probabilities (between 0 and 1).
