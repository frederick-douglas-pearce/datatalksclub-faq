There are many ways to identify the shape of dataset, one of them is using .shape attribute!

df.shape

df.shape[0] # for identify the number of rows

df.shape[1] # for identify the number of columns

We can also use the built-in `len` function to find the total number of rows in a dataframe, just as shown below:

len(df)
