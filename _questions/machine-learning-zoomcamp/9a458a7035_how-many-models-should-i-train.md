Regarding Point 4 in the midterm deliverables, which states, "Train multiple models, tune their performance, and select the best model," you might wonder, how many models should you train? The answer is simple: train as many as you can. The term "multiple" implies having more than one model, so as long as you have more than one, you're on the right track.
