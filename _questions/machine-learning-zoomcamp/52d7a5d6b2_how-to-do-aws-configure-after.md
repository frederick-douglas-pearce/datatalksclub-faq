Problem description:

In video 9.6, after installing aswcli, we should configure it with aws configure . There it asks for Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default Region Name and also Default output format. What we should put for Default output format? Leaving it as  None is okay?

Solution description:

Yes, in my I case I left everything as the provided defaults (except, obviously, the Access key and the secret access key)
