I have a problem with my terminal. Command

conda create -n ml-zoomcamp python=3.9

doesn’t work. Any of 3.8/ 3.9 / 3.10 should be all fine

If you’re on Windows and just installed Anaconda, you can use Anaconda’s own terminal called “Anaconda Prompt”.

If you don’t have Anaconda or Miniconda, you should install it first
