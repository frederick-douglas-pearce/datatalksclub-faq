This is my first time using Github to upload a code. I was getting the below error message when I type

git push -u origin master:

error: src refspec master does not match any

error: failed to push some refs to ''

Solution:

The error message got fixed by running below commands:

git commit -m "initial commit"

git push origin main

If this is your first time to use Github, you will find a great & straightforward tutorial in this link

You can also use the “upload file” functionality from GitHub for that

If you write your code on Google colab you can also directly share it on your Github.
