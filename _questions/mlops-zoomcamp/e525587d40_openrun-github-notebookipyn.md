Problem: Open/run github notebook(.ipynb) directly in Google Colab

Solution: Change the domain from 'github.com' to 'githubtocolab.com'. The notebook will open in Google Colab.

Only works with Public repo.

Navigating in Wandb UI became difficult to me, I had to intuit some options until I found the correct one.

Solution: Go to the official doc.
