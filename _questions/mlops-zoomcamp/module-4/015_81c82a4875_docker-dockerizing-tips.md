Ensure the correct image is being used to derive from.

- Copy the data from local to the Docker image using the `COPY` command to a relative path. Using absolute paths within the image might be troublesome.
- Use paths starting from `/app` and don’t forget to do `WORKDIR /app` before actually performing the code execution.

### Most Common Commands

- Build container:

  ```bash
  docker build -t mlops-learn .
  ```

- Execute the script:

  ```bash
  docker run -it --rm mlops-learn
  ```

`<mlops-learn>` is just a name used for the image and does not have any significance.
