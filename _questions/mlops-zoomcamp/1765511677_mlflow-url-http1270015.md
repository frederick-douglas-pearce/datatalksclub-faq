If you’re running MLflow on a remote VM, you need to forward the port too like we did in Module 1 for Jupyter notebook port 8888. Simply connect your server to VS Code, as we did, and add 5000 to the PORT like in the screenshot:

If you are running MLflow locally and 127.0.0.1:5000 shows a blank page navigate to localhost:5000 instead.
